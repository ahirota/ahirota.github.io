  	  <h2>Interests</h2>
  	  <h3>Animation</h3>
  	  <p>I was blessed to grow up with animated films and shows. The animation art form is something that I love because it is the most accurate extension of imagination in my opinion. As a kid who loved books and videogames, I imagined going to the places I read about or played through. Where I could be anybody I wished, such as a brave knight, or daring space pirate. Animation was the embodiment of these places, and told stories about the people who lived in these worlds, and often times these stories had huge moral implications that helped shape the mind of a young boy into the man he became. If you are interested, my recommendations (both old and new) are as follows.</p>
  	  <ul>
  	  	<li>The Iron Giant</li>
  	  	<li>Wreck-It Ralph</li>
  	  	<li>Mulan</li>
  	  	<li>Samurai Jack</li>
  	  	<li>Bojack Horseman</li>
  	  </ul>
  	  <br>
  	  <h3>Video Games</h3>
  	  <p>Video Games have always been a part of my life. My mom worked as an accountant in the Game Industry since I was a kid, and so I was always exposed to video games. I find them to be great fun and a powerful medium for storytelling. They also provide a very unique user experience that no other art form can imitate. If you are interested, my recommendations (both old and new) are as follows.</p>
  	  <ul>
  	  	<li>Spyro (The classic ones)</li>
  	  	<li>Rachet and Clank (The first three)</li>
  	  	<li>Jak and Daxter Series</li>
  	  	<li>Uncharted Series</li>
  	  	<li>The Witcher Trilogy</li>
  	  	<li>The Soulsborne Games</li>
  	  </ul>
